1. Copy this repository and set it up as new GitLab repo to version control the landingpage separate from the boilerplate
2. Use `yarn` to install all dependencies
3. Source files are located in `src`
4. You can fire up a dev server with `yarn watch`, this also watches all your files and rebuilds everything on the fly when you are making changes
5. Use `yarn prod` to generate production ready files. This will purge your CSS from all unused classes
